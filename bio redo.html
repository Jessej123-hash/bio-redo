        <p>Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela was born on July 18, 1918, in the village of Mvezo in Umtata, then part of South Africa's Cape Province. He was a member of the Thembu royal family. His father, Gadla Henry Mphakanyiswa Mandela, was a local chief and councilor to the monarch; his mother was Nosekeni Fanny.</p>
        <p>Mandela was educated at the University of Fort Hare and the University of Witwatersrand, where he studied law. He lived in Johannesburg, where he became involved in anti-colonial and African nationalist politics, joining the African National Congress in 1943 and co-founding its Youth League in 1944.</p>

        <p>In 1961, Mandela co-founded the armed wing of the ANC, Umkhonto we Sizwe, and led a sabotage campaign against the government, which had implemented apartheid policies that segregated and discriminated against non-white citizens.</p>
        <p>In 1962, he was arrested and convicted of sabotage and other charges and sentenced to life imprisonment in the Rivonia Trial. Mandela served 27 years in prison, initially on Robben Island and later in Pollsmoor Prison and Victor Verster Prison.</p>

        <p>After his release in 1990, Mandela led efforts to negotiate the end of apartheid, which resulted in the 1994 multiracial general election, where he became South Africa's first black president.</p>
        <p>His presidency marked the transition from minority rule and apartheid to a multicultural democracy. He served as president from 1994 to 1999 and was South Africa's first black head of state and the first elected in a fully representative democratic election.</p>
